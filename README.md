These codes combine the self-calibration and clustering-redshift angular correlation function information to jointly constrain the true-redshift distribution of a photo-z sample. It is the public code accompanying our paper  http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12009. Please refer to it for more details.  

You can start with main.py and change the input parameters and input files there. It requires the angular correlation measurements of the photo-z sample and the cross angular correlation function between the spec-z and photo-z sample. It also requires the covariance matrix of the angular correlation functions.
